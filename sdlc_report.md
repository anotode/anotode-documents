# SDLC Report

We are using v-shaped model for our Software Engineering project.
It is an extension for waterfall model.
Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape.
The major difference between v-shaped model and waterfall model is the early test planning in v-shaped model.
V-shaped model involves continuous testing of the project after each stage and we hope that this feature of it will help us 
guarantee success in our project.

To pick our SDLC model, we had to go through all the SDLC models and we keenly examined the pros and cons of each model. 
Here is a short account of those examinations. 


## Waterfall model

The waterfall Model is a linear sequential flow in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of software implementation. 
This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. 
The waterfall approach does not define the process to go back to the previous phase to handle changes in requirement.

#### Why choose v-shaped over it ? 

We chose v-shaped over it because waterfall model lacks integrated testing and has higher chances of failure than 
v-shaped model.


## Prototyping Model

It involves activity of creating prototypes of software applications before actually developing the final product. This is done to make sure that the project matches 
the requirements and the customer expectations. To do this, the prototype is created again and again until the customer requirements is satisfied. 

#### Why choose v-shaped over it ? 

We didn't have the time that prototyping model requires. 
The majority of time in Prototyping model goes in creating various versions of prototypes and we simply didn't have that much time. 


## Spiral Model

This model of development combines the features of the prototyping model and the waterfall model. Various iterations of product is created 
and the product is contiously being improved following customer's suggestions. Spiral model is said as a "meta" model because it is not a real model. 
When a software development project lasts only once cycle, it resembles Waterfall model.

#### Why choose v-shaped over it ?

Lot of time is required to reach the final product aslike Prototyping model. We didn't have that much time. 


## Iterative Model

It is developed to overcome the weaknesses of the waterfall model. 
It starts with an initial planning and ends with deployment with the cyclic interactions in between. 
The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), allowing software developers to take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier parts or versions of the system.

#### Why choose v-shaped over it ?

We choose incremental because it allows us to have a working version of a product early. 
If the increments are defined cleary, we will also be able to detect problems as they occur.
An early working version of product will help us invite testers and will also help with motivation levels of the team. 


## Agile

It is based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams.
This method requires a really experienced team and high input hours per day. It requires continuous inputs from customer and there is no room for guesswork. 

#### Why choose v-shaped over it ?

Most of the team members have little software development experience in our team so Agile methodology is not for us. 
Also we will not be able to take out the time for continuous interaction between teams that the Agile method requires due to classes and college timings.
