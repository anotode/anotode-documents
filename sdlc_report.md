# SDLC Report

We are using v-shaped model for our Software Engineering project.
It is an extension for waterfall model.
Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form the typical V shape.
The major difference between v-shaped model and waterfall model is the early test planning in v-shaped model.
V-shaped model involves continuous testing of the project after each stage and we hope that this feature of it will help us 
guarantee success in our project.

To pick our SDLC model, we had to go through all the SDLC models and we keenly examined the pros and cons of each model. 
Here is a short account of those examinations. 


## Waterfall model

The waterfall Model is a linear sequential flow in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of software implementation. 
This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. 
The waterfall approach does not define the process to go back to the previous phase to handle changes in requirement.

#### Why choose v-shaped over it ? 

We chose v-shaped over it because waterfall model lacks integrated testing and has higher chances of failure than 
v-shaped model.


## Prototyping Model

#### Why choose v-shaped over it ? 

We didn't have the time that prototyping model requires. 
The majority of time in Prototyping model goes in creating various versions of prototypes and we simply didn't have that much time. 


## Spiral Model
